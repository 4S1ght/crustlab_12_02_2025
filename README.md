# Assignment
The entire assignment's code is mostly self-contained and can be ran and tested after installing the necessary dependencies.

It was written and tested on the latest (at the time) available NodeJS LTS - 22.14.0.

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run tests (vitest):
```
npm run test
```
